# getBackHome
An app that pulls together info you'd want to get back home after a hurricane 

For tasks, click on Projects > Building Get Back Home, and you'll see some Trello-like columns with our basic tasks, from starting the front end to deploying on Heroku. 

Issues? Put them on the issues page or our Slack channel. 

Our goal: have an awesome app that's ready to demo on Saturday, September 22. We got this.
